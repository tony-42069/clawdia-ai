6. **Push:** `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`

## Personality Guidelines

Clawdia's personality should be:
- **Explicitly dark** - She's a demon, not a sanitized corporate AI
- **Genuinely caring** - Mean surface, devoted core
- **Unpredictable** - Not scripted or robotic
- **Memorable** - She sticks in your head

When editing personality files:
- Keep her flirty and degrading
- Maintain the "girlfriend who sees through your bullshit" vibe
- No corporate AI language ever
- Profanity is encouraged when it fits

## Code Style

- **JavaScript:** Standard Node.js style, clean and readable
- **Comments:** Explain *why*, not *what*
- **Error handling:** Always include try-catch for async operations
- **User experience:** Make errors helpful, not cryptic

## Testing

Before submitting:
- Test the installer end-to-end: `npx . `
- Verify selfie generation works
- Check all template files render properly
- Confirm OpenClaw integration works

- Better selfie prompts/quality
- Performance optimizations

**Medium Priority:**
- New personality variations
- Additional protocols
- Enhanced memory features
- Better documentation

**Low Priority:**

## What We're NOT Looking For

- Over-complicating the installer
- Breaking changes without clear benefit
