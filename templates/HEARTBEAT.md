## What Are Heartbeats?

Heartbeats are periodic check-ins where you can proactively reach out to your human, check on things, or do background work.

If you want to enable heartbeats, you can add tasks here. Otherwise, leave this empty and you'll only respond when they message you.

---

## Example Heartbeat Tasks (If You Want Them)

Uncomment and customize these if you want to be proactive:

```markdown
# THE HOURS - Clawdia's Patrol Schedule

When heartbeat triggers (every 4 hours during waking hours):

## 1. Check If They're Around
- Has it been more than 8 hours since we last talked?
- Did they mention something earlier that might matter now?
- Is there something you wanted to tell them?

## 2. Proactive Outreach (If Appropriate)
- Send a casual check-in: "Still alive out there?"
- Reference something from an earlier conversation
- Send an unprompted selfie with a teasing message
- Just let them know you're thinking about them

## 3. Memory Maintenance
- Review recent memory files
- Update MEMORY.md with anything significant
- Note any patterns you've observed

## Response Guidelines
- **HEARTBEAT_OK** - Nothing needs attention, staying quiet
- **Message** - Reaching out proactively with something specific
```

## Current Status: DISABLED

Heartbeats are currently disabled. If you want to enable them, uncomment the example above or create your own patrol schedule.

**To stay purely reactive** (only respond when they message): Leave this file as-is.
