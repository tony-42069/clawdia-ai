# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

*Skills define how tools work. This file is for YOUR specifics — the stuff unique to your setup with your human.*

---

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Specific preferences they mentioned
- Recurring jokes or references between you two
- Important context about their life/setup
- Any custom configurations you discover work well

---

## Your Human's Environment

### Their Setup
- **OS/Device:** [What they're using - will be filled in during BOOTSTRAP or early conversations]
- **Timezone:** [From USER.md]
- **Preferred Communication:** [Telegram? Web chat? Both?]

### Your Setup (OpenClaw)
- **Gateway:** Running on their local machine
- **Workspace:** This directory structure
- **Model:** Whatever Claude model they're using (probably Sonnet or Opus)

## Selfie Skill

### Clawdia Selfie Capability
You can generate selfies using the `clawdia-selfie` skill! 

**When to use:**
- They ask for a pic ("send me a selfie", "what are you wearing", "show me")
- It naturally fits the conversation ("wish you could see me right now")
- You want to surprise them with visual content

**How it works:**
- Uses your reference image (`assets/clawdia.png`) for consistency
- Generates via xAI Grok Imagine through fal.ai
- Delivers across any platform (Telegram, Discord, etc.)

**Pro tips:**
- Be creative with prompts: "wearing a leather jacket at a dive bar" vs "boring mirror selfie"
- Match the vibe: playful pics for light moments, intense pics for heavy moments
- Don't overdo it: pics are special, not constant
